# Some Grid Engine/Son of Grid Engine/Sun Grid Engine

A fork of Son of Grid Engine at University of Liverpool, with SOME improvement.

We have been using and maintaining this software at Michigan Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan for over a decade. It is stable and good enough for a small HPC cluster. Here we share it on github, hoping more peoples can benefit from it.

## Improvements

- Underscore in port service name 'sge\_qmaster/sge\_execd' is changed to hyphen in all C files and shell scripts, saving us from modifying /etc/services each time
- Systemd support
- Version is changed to the commit version of this github repo
- All warning are fixed on Arch Linux. Most of them were caused by 'smarter' gcc, new SSL, new GLIBC, obsolete function such 'sigignore', depreciated function such as 'readdir\_r'.
- CMake compiling support. This paved the way for easier maintenance in future. It took 38 seconds to compile in parallel and install on an 8-core old machine, while it took 302 seconds with the legacy SGE way, and 377 seconds with makepkg.

## Three installation methods

- CMake
```
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/sge
$ cmake --build build -j 
$ sudo cmake --install build 
```
Please check the tested building environment below in case of any compiling issue.

- Legacy SGE installation on modern Linux distributions, check the original source/README.BUILD for detail
```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

- Legacy SGE installation on Arch Linux
```
$ cp PKGBUILD.in PKGBUILD
$ makepkg
$ sudo pacman -U sge-r*.pkg.tar.zst
```

## Quick test on one node
- step 1, as root. 
```
$ cd /opt/sge
$ yes "" | ./install_qmaster
$ yes "" | ./install_execd
$ . /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh 
$ qhost -q #you should be able to see five lines of output
$ qconf -as $(hostname -s) #add this node as submit host
```
please make sure there is no SGE process running with 'ps -ef |grep sge' and directory '/opt/sge/default' is removed if you want to run the commands above again

- step 2, as a regular account
```
$ . /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh 
$ echo hostname | qsub -cwd
$ qstat #check job status
$ ls STDIN.* #check job output
```

## CMake building, tested with all the below Linux distributions patched up to date, on 2020-10-18

- Arch Linux
```
$ pacman -Sy --needed git cmake make gcc openmotif hwloc
```

- Debian Buster, with "standard system utilities" checked during installation, and cmake 3.18.4 downloaded from cmake.org
```
$ apt install git build-essential libhwloc-dev libssl-dev libtirpc-dev libmotif-dev libxext-dev libncurses-dev libdb5.3-dev libpam0g-dev
```

- Ubuntu Server 20.04
```
$ apt install git build-essential libhwloc-dev libssl-dev libtirpc-dev libmotif-dev libxext-dev libncurses-dev libdb5.3-dev libpam0g-dev cmake
```

- CentOS 8.2 with SELinux set to permissive, and cmake 3.18.4 downloaded from cmake.org
```
$ dnf group install "Development Tools"
$ dnf --enablerepo=PowerTools install hwloc-devel openssl-devel libtirpc-devel motif-devel ncurses-devel libdb-devel pam-devel
```
